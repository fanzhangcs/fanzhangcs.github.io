Welcome! I am currently a Professor of CIAT, the Co-director of the Big Data Computing and Intelligence Institute, and Executive Vice Director of the Intelligent Transportation Joint Lab, at Guangzhou University. I was a research associate at the University of New South Wales and a visiting fellow at East China Normal University, advised by Prof. Xuemin Lin. I got my Ph.D. from the Australian Artificial Intelligence Institute, the University of Technology Sydney in 2018, advised by Prof. Ying Zhang and Prof. Lu Qin. I received my Bachelor's degree from Zhejiang University in 2014. 

My research interests focus on large-scale graph management and analysis, including cohesive subgraphs, graph decomposition, network stability, information cascade, graph summarization, and outlier detection.
